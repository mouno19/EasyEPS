# EasyEPS — Continuation Guide for Future Sessions

This repository is the durable cache for the EasyEPS project. **Do not regenerate or re-download anything that already exists here.**

## Where things live

| Artifact | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Lesson content (curriculum) | `content/lessons/lesson-01.json` … `lesson-60.json` | One file per chapter, schema in `content/SCHEMA.md` |
| Content manifest | `content/manifest.json` | Records which chapters are complete + validation counts |
| Lesson schema spec | `content/SCHEMA.md` | Canonical schema every lesson follows |
| Chapter list | `shared/chapters.ts` | All 60 chapter titles (ko/bn/en) and categories |
| Web application | entire repo | React 19 + Tailwind 4 + Express + tRPC + Drizzle (MySQL) |
| Feature tracker | `todo.md` | Checked items are done |

## How to resume

1. Clone this repo and read `content/manifest.json`.
2. Only author lessons whose chapter numbers are **missing** from the manifest — never regenerate existing ones.
3. New lessons must validate against `content/SCHEMA.md` v2 (20 practice questions, 19–20 EPS questions with ≥5 reading and ≥3 listening, 30–35 vocabulary items each).
4. After authoring, run `python3 scripts/update-manifest-eps.py` to re-sync `content/manifest.json`, then `pnpm content:audit` to confirm both audits pass, and push to GitHub immediately. `scripts/audit_runtime_contract.py` runs in CI and fails if the manifest drifts from the lesson files.
5. Optional: when `DATABASE_URL` is set, seed the database with `node scripts/seed-lessons.mjs` (idempotent upsert by chapter). Public curriculum reads JSON files directly and does not require this step.

## Key decisions already made

- Curriculum content is **original authored content** (not copied from the official textbook) covering the standard 60 EPS-TOPIK textbook topics.
- No official textbook PDFs are stored in this repo (license); they are not required to resume.
- Audio is generated dynamically via speech-synthesis integration — no pre-recorded audio files anywhere.
- Interface: Bangla default, Korean/English secondary. Design: sacred geometry, cream bg + golden line art + navy headlines.
